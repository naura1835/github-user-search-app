# Github User Search App

## Overview

The challenge was to replicate a github user search design with dark mode and light, and as 
a bonus have the correct color scheme chosen for them based on their computer preferences. The github user API was used for this challenge

## Challenge

The challenging part of this all was configuring the color scheme to work with a user computer preferences and also making the 
buttons to switch between light and dark work correctly.

Also i did'nt anticapte the amount of DOM manipulation i had to do, but it was a good practice so Yay!

### What i've learned

Building this project i have learned more about sass un terms of working with mixins and variables. I learned about how to convert SASS variables to CSS variables

I've learned about debouncing in javascript but i have never worked with it so this was an opportunity to do so, it was a bit challenging configuring everything at first,
 but i managed to make it work so yes.
 
Before this project i didnt know you could access matchMedia with javascript and even add an event listener so yes this was a fun new discovery.
